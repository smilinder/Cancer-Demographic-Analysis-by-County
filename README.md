Examining the Incidence of Cancer by County Demographics
By Scott Milinder
The merging of State Cancer Profiles from the National Cancer Institutes and the Center for Disease Control with demographic datasets from the United States Department of Agriculture results in a multidimenional view of cancer incidence at the level of U.S. states and counties. The comprehensive county-level cancer data includes age-adjusted indicent rates for all cancer types. This dataset is merged with demographic features in the categories of population, birth and death rates, education attainment, employment, and poverty levels.
This project is intended as an exploration of these datasets, to spotlight noteworthy observations, and to highlight specific analytic techniques. The US has about 3000 counties, so I saw no possibility of a machine learning application to emerge from these demographic and cancer datasets. My hope was that interesting observations and associations would emerge and suggest new paths of further inquiring with more granular data, such as by using individual cancer incidence or by examining more granular demographic categories and cancer types.
This project employs the OSEMN framework for the data science development process. The phases in this framework follow this sequence but sometimes we must iterate as we find new information, especially as we explore the data and new requirements arise. We do this in an agile way as possible.Â¶
